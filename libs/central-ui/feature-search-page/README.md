# central-ui-feature-search-page

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

Provides the base search functionality for the central-ui application.

Default view is a simple search that will return data to a table. Optionally, a `grid view` mode can be enabled that will allow the user to edit data returned to the search page. This is done by passing `true` to `gridModeEnabled`.

Available feature flags:

-   \*.search.grid
-   \*.search.dataSync
-   \*.search.clickRow
-   \*.search.clickRowEdit
